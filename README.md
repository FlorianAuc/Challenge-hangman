# Hangman

- Type of challenge: **consolidation**
- Repository: `Hangman`
- Challenge: **solo**
- Duration : **3 days**
- Deadline : **11/03/2022**

## The mission

You have to make a website version of the [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) word game. To do so
try to think the *structure*, the "*backend*" (functionality) and the *frontend*
(design) of your project before you start coding.

**At the very least your version of the *hangman* should:**

- propose an hidden word
- allow the selection of letters
- verify if a selected letter belongs to the word
- count the number of failure (lives)
- check if it's a *game over*
- check if the word as been found

**Optionally it can**:

- keep in memory all guessed letters
- only let the player guess a letter once
- add an image for each step
- check keyboard recognition
